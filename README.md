## Dropbox-powered Blog Thing

Inspired by http://joehewitt.com/2011/10/03/dropbox-is-my-publish-button.

### Setup

 1. Download the latest release of DpBT and unpack it to a folder on your server
 2. Configure your site using the the `config.json` file
 6. If everything is setup correctly, make a symlink from your blog posts folder to the `/posts` folder in the root of this project
    Example: `ln -s ~/Dropbox/blog/posts ./posts` where `./posts` is the posts folder in the root of the project
 7. Start the server (if setup correctly it should just work): node server.js
 8. From your original posts folder, you can create new, or convert old, markdown posts with the filename `.md`
    and the following format 
    ```
    ---
    title: This is the post title
    date: 2014-08-08
    tags (optional): a tag, another tag
    type (optional): page # used to denote a static page accessible in the navigation rather than a post
    <other metadata in the form of key: value>
    ---

    # Header

    This is some awesome content
    ```


## Global template variables

There are a tonne of template variables to be used, but the basics are:

`baseUrl` - the base URL of the site, example: 
```html
<head>
  <base href="{{baseUrl}}" />
  <title></title>
</head>
```

`gravatar` - the URL to your gravatar image based on the value of `site.author.email` in `config.json`
```html
<img src="{{gravatar}}" alt="This is my avatar" />
```

``

The rest of the variables are available via their respective route. A few are:
```
GET / 
> {
    posts: Array   // an array of post objects
  }

GET /page/2
> {
    page        : Integer, // the current pagination page number
    posts       : Array,   // an array of post objects
    pagination  : Object   // an object containing pagination data
  }

GET /this-is-a-post-title
> {
    meta    : Object, // contains at least *title* and *date*, can also contain arbitrary meta data
    content : String  // the post content in a large string
  }

GET /rss(.xml) (.xml in url is optional)
> Generated Atom 1.0 XML feed for RSS of all posts

GET /sitemap(.xml) (.xml in url is optional)
> Generated sitemap XML feed for all pages and posts on site for sitemap


[COMING SOON]
GET /tag/a-simple-tag
```

All routes accept JSON headers so you can retreive your posts via a JSON API :).
